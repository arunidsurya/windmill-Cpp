# windmill-Cpp

In this code, the windmill blade is drawn using a triangle. The display() function is responsible for drawing the windmill by rotating and scaling the blade. The update() function is called repeatedly using glutTimerFunc() to update the rotation angle and redraw the windmill at regular intervals.

Make sure to have the OpenGL library installed and properly linked to your project. Compile and run the code, and you should see a window displaying the rotating windmill blades.

Change the extension of the executable file to ".exe".

Pressing the '+' key increases the rotation speed by 1, while pressing the '-' key decreases it by 1.The maxium speed is limited to 10 and the minimum speed is 1.
